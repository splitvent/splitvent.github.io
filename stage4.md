The final stage of this project is to consider how the designs could be clinically implemented.

A key question for this stage is how to optimally deploy a split ventilator strategy in order to maximise ventilatory capacity. We hypothesize that the the benefits of split ventilation will not, as has previously been suggested, result in a doubling of ventilatory capacity but will rather result in a still potentially sizeable increase in capacity.

Our approach here is to mathematically model the implications of split ventilation on patient flow based on real-world coronavirus patient data. We will subsequently aim to develop a protocol for how the dual ventilator method (with the splitter) could be implemented, including for example which patients may be eligible, how initiation of split ventilation could be implemented and how patients may be weaned from this therapy when appropriate.
