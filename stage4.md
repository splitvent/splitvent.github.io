The final stage is to work out how this design would be clinically implemented, any boundaries to this and the potential implications on factors such as patient flow and ventilator capacity. We will work to mathematically model the implications on patient flow. We will also aim to develop a protocol for how the dual ventilator method (with the splitter) could work i.e. which patients would be eligible, what would be involved in the pathway to going on to the dual ventilator method and how weaning should happen following this.
