We designed an electrical circuit as an analogue to the ventilator, this simulated connecting the ventilator to the two patients and the lungs of each patient. In mapping from the air flow to an electrical circuit we equate volume to charge, flow to current, pressure to voltage, resistance to resistance and compliance to capacitance. We will use this model to test the splitter in various different configurations and can simulate varying physiology and disease process (varying compliance/ resistance) in the 2 lung models.

### Results so far

You can read the [pre-print of our paper](http://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20056309v1),
submitted to Royal Society of Science for peer review. 
We used this model to demonstrate use of both the previously suggested basic Y connector splitter and our modified splitter. The model showed that using the modified setup, we can demonstrate that it is possible to achieve the same tidal volumes in 2 patients with mismatched lung compliances and that tidal volume of one patient can be manipulated independently of the other.
