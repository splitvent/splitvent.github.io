A major barrier to clinical implementation of a split ventilator protocol is the ability to independently monitor each patient. 

During pressure-controlled ventilation, it is of crucial importance to be able to monitor the tidal volume that the ventilator is delivering to each individual patient for the given pressure delivered. We know that in ARDS the aim would be for a lung protective ventilation strategy in which being able to monitor, and individual control of tidal volumes is therefore vital.

In this stage of the project we aim to develop systems and strategies to measure/monitor tidal volume and therefore enable titration of the tidal volumes delivered to each patient.
