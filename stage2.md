In implementing this system, we are assuming use of pressure-controlled ventilation, it would therefore be of crucial importance to be able to monitor the tidal volume that the ventilator is delivering to each individual patient for the given pressure delivered. We know that in ARDS the aim would be for a lung protective ventilation strategy in which being able to monitor, and control individual tidal volumes delivered to the patients is vital.
In this stage of the project we aim to develop systems and strategies to easily measure/ monitor and therefore enable adjustment of the tidal volumes delivered to each patient.
