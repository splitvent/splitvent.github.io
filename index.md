title: SplitVent
subtitle: Developing a dual patient, single ventilator strategy
---

In light of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, there is worldwide concern at the availability of specialist equipment to care for the most unwell patients. COVID-19 can lead to severe viral pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) requiring advanced respiratory support including invasive ventilation.
A particular concern is the limited ventilator capacity to deal with the numbers of patients who are estimated to required ventilation at the peak of the pandemic.

The idea of sharing a ventilator between varying numbers of patients has been proposed previously (relating to trauma victims) and also again during the current pandemic, where it has been tested in Italy. Despite this it has not been widely adopted and has raised a number of concerns mainly around the inability to affectively ventilate patients with differing lung physiology who will require differing ventilation parameters. 

### Aim

The aim of this work is to develop a 3D-printable splitter which allows two patients to be ventilated using one ventilator whilst customising and allowing the independent adjustment of the ventilatory parameters delivered to each patient. Therefore, attempting to address some of the concerns raised regarding use of a split ventilator.

### Approach

We have established an international project team with experts in the fields of computational fluid dynamics, 3D printing, intensive care, anaesthesiology and medical physics. The project will be conducted in 4 stages, with decisions made at the end of each stage to guide progression to the next.
