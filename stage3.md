title: Stage 3
subtitle: Moving from Theoretical to Practical
---

In this phase of the project we will seek to developing practical implementations form our theoretical models including designs for the components. Where necessary, computational fluid dynamics modelling will be used to evaluate candidate designs. Bench testing of these components will subsequently be conducted using a ventilator and a test lung model.

A key aim in this stage of the project is to use readily-availbale components, or components which can be 3D printed. Additional design requirements include longeivity of the components, ease of use and the ability to adjust tidal volumes without interrupting the ventilatory circuit.
